h1. Introduction

This project is in early alpha so please post issues, etc that you may find. All feedback is appreciated, thx!

A reusable "Django":http://djangoproject.com application for managing quotes and testimonials.

I"ve created this both for my old blog "howiworkdaily.com":http://howiworkdaily.com and for my company site "montylounge.com":http://montylounge.com so why not make it reusable?


h2. Notes

Out of the box the application provides a list and detail view for <code>Quote</code> objects and a list view for <code>Testimonial</code> objects.


h2. Dependencies

django-tagging
